Welcome to my CTF. 
Subject category,... Steganography.

We Monkeys are the masters at peeling bannanas. 
Bannanas usually contain details that often get overlooked.
And you humans claim to be smarter and more evolved then we are, and yet you dont see what we see.
You say that there is more than one way to skin a cat.
But i say that there is more than one way to peel a Bannana.
Prove me Wrong.

Sincerely, "Donkey Kong"

Please download and inspect the _BANNANAS_.png file.
There is NO MALWARE in this file.
its still however best practice to operate in a safe virtual sandbox Environment.
