Welcome to my CTF.

We Monkeys are the masters at peeling bannanas. 
Bannanas contain details that often get overlooked.
And you humans claim to be smarter and more evolved then we are?
Some people say that there is more than one way to skin a cat.
But i say that there is more than one way to peel a Bannana.
Prove me Wrong.

Sincerely, "Donkey Kong"
