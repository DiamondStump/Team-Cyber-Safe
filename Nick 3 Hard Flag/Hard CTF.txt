i like to keeps my red plastic monkey in my pocket,... they tend to fall out of my pockets when i play around the house,... ive noticed that i lost a few of 
them lately

Hint 1
Me and my Brother love making cardboard box forts in the backyard, he calls the forts that he creates his "Domains",... he tells me not to play in them, but 
i do anyways,... Maybe i left one of my plastic red monkeys in one of his forts.

Hint 2
Sometimes i will like to take from the stack of old newspapers to make paper hats,... most people use social media to get their news and etc, but my parents 
still read the newspaper,... maybe i left one of my monkeys somewhere in that stack.

Hint 3
We have this little slot in our door for mail to slip in,... but my mom tries to take them and put them on a high shelf next to the door so that i cant reach 
them,... but im very determined so i got a chair to stand on, and i jump to swipe the letters down and i fell on the floor,... it hurt but not too bad. i 
looked at the mail and saw one intresting letter from a bank and i opened it and found a "DEB-it" card. I didnt have much time,... my mom was coming and i had 
to get out of there fast so i dropped everything and ran. i still got in trouble for it later. however maybe throughout all that mess i might have dropped my 
red plastic monkey.

Hint 4
My parents dont like it when we play in the "MUD" in the front yard,... but when we do i like to pretend to be a big giant mud monster,... and my cousin
likes to pretend and call himself "The Courageous Paladin" and will try and capture me with my dad's giant fishing "net",... but my little brother likes to 
"tel" on  us,... i need to go back to see if any of my monkeys fell outside near or in the mud.

Now that i have all my monkeys safe in their barrel,...I have learned my lesson,... ill keep all my monkeys in the barrel from now on.
