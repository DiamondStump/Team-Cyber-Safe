Me and my Brother love making cardboard box forts in the backyard, he calls the forts that he creates his "Domain",... he tells me not to play in them, but 
i do anyways,... Maybe i left one of my red monkeys in there when playing with him.

Sometimes i like to take from the stack of old newspapers to make paper hats,...maybe i left one of my monkeys under that stack,... most people use social 
media to get their news, but my parents still read the paper.
