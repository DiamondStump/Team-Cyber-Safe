i like to keeps my red plastic monkey in my pocket,... they tend to fall out of my pockets when i play around the house,... ive noticed that i lost a few of them lately

Hint 1
Me and my Brother love making cardboard box forts in the backyard, he calls the forts that he creates his "Domains",... he tells me not to play in them, but 
i do anyways,... Maybe i left one of my plastic red monkeys in one of his forts.

Hint 2
Sometimes i will like to take from the stack of old newspapers to make paper hats,...maybe i left one of my monkeys somewher in that stack,... most people use

NNTP

Hint 3
My parents dont like it when we play in the "MUD" in the front yard,... but when we do i like to pretend to be a big giant mud monster,... and my cousin will 
like to try and capture me with my dad's fishing "net",... but my little brother likes to "tel" on us,... i need to go back to see if any of my monkeys 
fell in the mud.
Telnet + Mud server,... use tellnet in cmd to type in muddomain and port number,... create an account and character,... and make the character say the Flag.






Ive learned my lesson,... ill keep my monkeys in the barrel from now on.
