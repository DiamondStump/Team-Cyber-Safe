My Brother has a cardboard box fort in the backyard, he calls it his "Domain",... Maybe i left it there when playing with him.

Sometimes i like to take from the stack of old newspapers to make paper hats,...maybe i left my monkeys under that stack,... most people use social media to
get their news, but my parents still read the paper.
