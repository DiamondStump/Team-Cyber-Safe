Subject category,... File forensics.



Welocme to the amazon!
There are many primatologists who try to find us non-demesticated monkeys in the wild in their natural habitat.
Its nice to see that you want to be one of them, but the beginners usually have a hard time trying to spot us.
You may "hear" us, but you wont necessarily "see" us. And it may be hard to spot us for that reason.
But sense your new to the feild ill give you a hint. 
The experts like to leave a... "Trail_of_Bannanas"... to lure us into the open.

Please download and inspect the Amazon_Forest.jpg file.
There is NO MALWARE in this file.
its still however best practice to operate in a safe virtual sandbox Environment.
