Explaning hexidecimal values.
     - Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system.
          - The decimal equivalent of hex is as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
          -  It uses 16 digits: 0-9 and A-F, where A stands for 10, B for 11, and so on up to F for 15.
     - A bit can either represent a 0 or a 1. This is binary,... the core of all computer language.
     - A byte consists of a total of 8 bits. or eight 0s and 1s. 
     - In hexidecimal, each digit represents 4 bits (aka a half of a byte). Therefore, two hex digits (4 bits + 4 bits) represent a single byte. So again each 
       pair represents a single byte.
     - Example: 1A in hex is equivalent to 00011010 in binary, and it represents a single byte.
          - Hex "1" corresponds to binary 0001
            Hex "2" corresponds to binary 0010
            Hex "3" corresponds to binary 0011
            Hex "4" corresponds to binary 0100
            Hex "5" corresponds to binary 0101
            Hex "6" corresponds to binary 0110
            Hex "7" corresponds to binary 0111
            Hex "8" corresponds to binary 1000
            Hex "9" corresponds to binary 1001
            Hex "A" corresponds to binary 1010
            Hex "B" corresponds to binary 1011
            Hex "C" corresponds to binary 1100
            Hex "D" corresponds to binary 1101
            Hex "E" corresponds to binary 1110
            Hex "F" corresponds to binary 1111
