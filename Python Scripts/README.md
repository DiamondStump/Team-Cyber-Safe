# Python Scripts Collection

This Directory contains personal scripts that I have made and have used on a practival level.  
Sometimes I will encounter a challenge and will have an idea to create a script to streamline the process.  
It's really a growing random list,... and i have tweeked them to make it available for use to the public.  
So enjoy.  
  
For now I have two useful Python scripts:  
One for managing email campaigns and another for generating secure random passwords.  
These scripts are designed to be simple yet effective tools for common tasks.  
  
## Script Description
  
If you want to learn what each script does you can always look at the python code.  
The code will contain comments at the top explaining what to expect, it's purpose, what it does, and how to use it.
