## Scripts Included

### 1. Email Campaign Script

Helps you land a job!
This script helps automate and manage private personal email campaigns specifically for emailing employees and recruiters in their respective organizations.
It is a form of social networking, it gets you noticed and makes you stand out from the rest of the applicants.
Replies from employees can then be used to name drop them in a cover letter,... and sometimes an actual referral can come out of it!
Overall:
The script allows you to send bulk emails, customize content, and manage recipient lists.

**Usage:**
1. Configure your SMTP server and credentials in the script.
2. Prepare your email content and recipient list.
