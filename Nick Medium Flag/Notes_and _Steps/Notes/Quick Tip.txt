All the Notes in this folder showcase a non-comprehensive approach to discovering anomolies in file types using a hex editor.
i say "non-comprehensive" because there are so many methods that it would be to much to list them all.

However i just want to provide a quick tip. 
But before i do i just want to say that i had a pastor say to me that. " You dont become better at disvovering counter-fit 100$ by studying 
what is fake, but rather through observing the genuine article"

i thought to myself that the same is true for findind anomlies in file types.
So the tip i want to provide is take time to understand the "file stucture" of any given file that you are suspicous about if you hit a roadbloack. 
You do this for the purpose of getting familiar with what is considered normal for that file, so that it will be easier to distinguish if anything is fishy
or out of the normal.
