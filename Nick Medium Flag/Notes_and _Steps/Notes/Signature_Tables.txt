All files of course are writtin in binary
Hex editors convert that binary into hexcidecimal fomate in order to convert it into ASCII so that we can read it easier.

however all files have "hex signatures" or rather the "hex editor" converts the binary into Hexadecimal to expose that 
it has set predefined signatures that are unique for each type of file. But overall those "Hex Signatures" again are a 
unique set of predefined hex values that are specific to a type of file in order to mark the start and end of a file.
However not all files have ending hex signatures,... which can also be called "trailers".
Here is a link that shows a table of all the starting "hex signatures" and "trailers" for each type of file.
