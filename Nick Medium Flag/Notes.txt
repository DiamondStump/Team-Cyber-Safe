Explaning hexidecimal values in correlation to bits and bytes.
     - Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system.
          - The base-16 number system is as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
          - It uses 16 digits: 0-9 and A-F, where A stands for 10, B for 11, and so on up to F for 15.
          - 0: 0
          - 1: 1
          - 2: 2
          - 3: 3
          - 4: 4
          - 5: 5
          - 6: 6
          - 7: 7
          - 8: 8
          - 9: 9
          - A: 10
          - B: 11
          - C: 12
          - D: 13
          - E: 14
          - F: 15
     - In general a bit can either represent a 0 or a 1. This is binary,... the core of all computer language.
     - A byte consists of a total of 8 bits,... or a collection of eight 0s and 1s,... such as 00101100.
     - When it comes to hexidecimal pairs such as "3F", each charcter/digit represents 4 bits (aka a half of a byte). Therefore, two hex digits 
       (4 bits + 4 bits) represents a single byte. So again each hex pair all together represents a single byte.
     - Example: "1A" in hex is equivalent to 00011010 in binary, and it represents a single byte.
          - Think of binary as a base-2 number system,... because thats essentially what it is. 
          - Hex "1" corresponds to binary 0001
            Hex "2" corresponds to binary 0010
            Hex "3" corresponds to binary 0011
            Hex "4" corresponds to binary 0100
            Hex "5" corresponds to binary 0101
            Hex "6" corresponds to binary 0110
            Hex "7" corresponds to binary 0111
            Hex "8" corresponds to binary 1000
            Hex "9" corresponds to binary 1001
            Hex "A" corresponds to binary 1010
            Hex "B" corresponds to binary 1011
            Hex "C" corresponds to binary 1100
            Hex "D" corresponds to binary 1101
            Hex "E" corresponds to binary 1110
            Hex "F" corresponds to binary 1111 
Converting Hex to ASCII
     - to makes things easy lets look at the number 125 in base-10,...which is what most people on earth are familiar with,... which is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
          - if we were in kindergarden the teacher would say; 
          - 5 is in the one's place. 
          - 2 is in the ten's place.
          - and 1 is in the hundred's place.
     - but what about 1642? The Teacher would then say.
          - 2 is in the one's place. 
          - 4 is in the ten's place.
          - 6 is in the hundred's place.
          - and 1 is in the thousand's place.
          - Do you see the pattern?
     - For base-16 the process is a little bit different. Lets look at 120. (This doesnt make sense for reasons that im not going to explain, but is only 
                                                                                                                               for demonstration purposes)
          - The 0 would be in the one's place.
          - however 2 would exist in the 16teen's place.
          - and 1 would exist in the 256's place.
          - seems rather confusing.
     - Let me help you make sense of this,... going back to base-10. lets look back at 1642.
          - have you ever asked yourself why is 6 in the hundred's place?
          - The quick anwnser is because 10 is being multipled by itself once. 
               - 10 x 10 = 100
                    or 
               - 10^2 power = 100
          - Lets do it again,... why is 1 in the thousand's place?
          - It because 10 is being multipled by itself twice.
               - 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000
                      or
               - 10^3 power = 1000
      - Going back to base-16,... lets look at 120. (This doesnt make sense for reasons im not going to explain, but is only for demonstration purposes)
           - why is 1 in the 256's place? it looks like it's in the hundred's place,... but its actually in the 256's place, but why?
           - it's because 16 is being multplied by itself once.
                - 16 x 16 = 256
                    or
                - 16^2 power = 256
          - Starting to make sense now.
          - Lets do it again,... why is 2 in the 16teen's place? it looks like it's in the ten's place,... but its actually in the 16teen's place, but why?
          - Remember base-16 starts over back at the beggining after it reaches its 16th digit. (which according to base-16 is F)
               - base-10 starts over after it reaches 9.
          - So to answer that question is because 16 is not being multipled by itself at all.
               - 16 x 1 = 16
                     or
               - 16^1 power = 16
           - The same would apply to a digit in the ten's place for base-10.
     - In this case we are only working with pairs of Hexadecimal values. 
          - So we wont be seeing 3 or more digits in a row,... only 2. WHich means less math,... which makes things easier.
     - SO what does the Hexadecimal value of "6E" represent,... remember this is base-16?
          - E is in the one's place,... and by itslef is equal to 14
          - 6 is in the 16teen's place,... and by itself is equal to 6
          - so with this information we can use the formula below to find the answer.
               - Remember to use the order of operations.
               - (14×16^0)+(6×16^1)
                    - Again "E" by itself is equal to 14 and is in the one's place,... 14 will then be multiplied against the power of the "place unit" 
                      that it exists in,... which again is the one's place and it looks like this (16^0),... which is basically 16x0. All together it is 
                      (14×16^0),... The answer to this would be 14.
                         - You might be saying 16^0 equals 0,.. and 14x0 equals 0,... so how can it be 14?
                         - I get it,... your correct,... and you should always follow this rule,... But In this case when multipling a number against a 
                           number thats being multipled to the "0 power" it just ceases to exist,... which leaves 14 as the only remaining number as the 
                           answer,... normally you would never do this,... but this is a unique exception so that we can get our answer.
                    - Again "6" by itself is equal to 6 and is in the 16teen's place,... 6 will then be multipled against the power of the "place unit" 
                      that it exists in,... which again is the 16teen's place and it looks like this (16^1),... which is basically 16x1. All together it is 
                      (6×16^1),... the answer to this is 96.
                    - And then you take the sum of both of those Answers and add them together.
               - 14+96  =  110
     - SO all in all the Hexadecimal value of "6E" has a numerical value of "110".
     - This is where things get easier because now it time to convert Hex to ASCII.
          - The true answer to this is that there is no conversion process.
          - ASCII basically has a table,... which is basically a long list of every character that exists on your keyboard,... and each character on that 
            list is assigned a numerical value.
          - There is no purpose in trying to memorize that entire list.
          - But anyways,..In this case "110" is the numerical value that is assigned for the letter "n" for ASCII.
          - Your computer will do the math above to find the numerical value of hexcidecimal pairs,... and once it finds that numerical value it will 
            compare it to the table/list to see which character that number represents,... and then display that character on your screen,... and the 
            process repeats itself for every hex pair that exists after that.
          - What if you already had the numerical value of a hex pair and wanted to look at that ASCII table/list for yourself?
                    - Well you could easily find it somwhere online if you really wanted too.
