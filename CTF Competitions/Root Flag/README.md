# Welcome to my CTF!
### Machine Infiltration/RCE and Privilege escalation.

## Let's begin!!!
Salutations everyone!  
We here at "Blackmarket United" we have recently discovered a new unique situation that has been blowing up recently and has been 
getting a lot of attention in the scientific community.  
Appearently an agricultural scientist with experience in avian biology seems to have aquired his hands on a new breed of goose.   
For the first time in histroy he was able to accidently turn fiction into reality. He currently owns a goose that lays golden eggs! I know this is rather silly, but it's true.  
But more than that he was able to use this gold to buy top of the line technology to do his research on this goose. 
Presumably to replicate his supposed findings.
But now he is faced with a different problem. He does not have all of the Knowledge and skills to do this alone. He is now reaching out to the public over the 
internet to find trusted individuals to whom can help him in his research. 
All we know is that this goose lays golden eggs. 
Its up to you find and hack into these devices that he is using to reach out to the public in order Help us enumerate a plan to steal this goose!

## The Goal/Disclaimer

Nice! Before we begin lets cover some ground rules.
The gist of this CTF is to download the [VictimCTF.ova](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18iAVf0B_164ajRm4T7VZj3XwJL74VSsd/view?usp=sharing) file and use "Virtualbox" to create a VM using that file.
You are only allowed to boot the VM using that .ova file and get it to run,... and that's it. Dont do anyhting else.
For what its worth,.. its supposed to simulate a remote device that you dont have physical access to.
Your next goal is to then create a 2nd seperate VM and get both of the VMs you created to connect to each to each other on the same netowork.
This will all be done using your "virtual Manager". (Preferably Virtualbox.) 
At which point it is up to you to use your Hacking Intuition to use your newly created vm to hack into the victim machine and perform privileged escalation 
into the root user.
Lets get started!
