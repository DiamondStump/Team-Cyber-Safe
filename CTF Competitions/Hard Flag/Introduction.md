# Welcome to my CTF!  
### Network Analysis.  

## Let's begin!!!

My name is Timmy and i love to play like with my red plastic monkeys,... I'm supposed to put my monkeys back in their barrel when im done playing with them.  
but i preffer to leave them in my pocket.  
When i was counting my red plastic monkeys i noticed i was missing 4 of them.  
I suppose they might have fallen out of my pockets when i was playing around the house.  
Can you help me find them?  

## The Goal/Disclaimer

Before we start this CTF there are a couple things that need to be explained.  
The Flag that you need to find for this CTF is a makeup of words that have been seperated into 4 Pieces.  
These 4 words,... when put together in the correct order reveals the flag.  
And these 4 peices have been scattered throughout the .pcapng file.  
And the name of this .pcapng file that you ned to download is called is ["Plactic_Monkeys.pcapng"](https://github.com/Nicholas-Heitman/Portfolio/blob/main/CTF%20Competitions/Hard%20Flag/Plactic_Monkeys.pcapng).  
It's up to you to find out how you will open the file and find the portions of the flag!  
Rest assured there is no Malware in this pcapng file.  

## Clues and Hints


Hint 1:  
Me and my Brother love making cardboard box forts in the backyard, he calls the forts that he creates his "Domains",... he tells me not to play in them, but 
i do anyways,... Maybe i left one of my plastic red monkeys in one of his forts.

Hint 2:  
Sometimes i will like to take from the stack of old newspapers to make paper hats,... most people use social media to get their news and etc, but my parents 
still read the newspaper,... maybe i left one of my monkeys somewhere in that stack.

Hint 3:  
We have this little slot in our door for mail to slip in,... but my mom tries to take them and put them on a high shelf next to the door so that i cant 
reach them,... but im very determined, so i  decided to get a chair to stand on, and as i jumped to swipe the letters down i fell on the floor,... it hurt but not too 
bad. i eventually looked at the mail and saw one intresting letter from my parent's bank and i opened it and found a "DEB-it" card. I didnt have much time,... my mom was coming 
and i had to get out of there fast so i dropped everything and ran. i still got in trouble for it later. __HOWEVER__,... maybe throughout all that mess i might have dropped my red plastic monkey.

Hint 4:  
My parents dont like it when we play in the "MUD" in the front yard,... but when we do i like to pretend to be a big giant mud monster,... and my cousin
likes to pretend and call himself "The Courageous Paladin" and will try and capture me with my dad's giant fishing "net",... but my little brother likes to 
"tel" on  us,... i need to go back to see if any of my monkeys fell outside near or in the mud.  

Now that i have all my monkeys safe in their barrel,...I have learned my lesson,... ill keep all my monkeys in the barrel from now on.
