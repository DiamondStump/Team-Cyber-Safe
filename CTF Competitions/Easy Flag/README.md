# Welcome to my CTF. 
### Digital Forensics


## Let's Begin
We Monkeys are the masters of peeling bannanas.  
And we know a thing or two when it come to Bannanas,... they usually contain details that often get overlooked.  
Yet you humans claim to be smarter and more evolved then we are, and yet you dont see what we see.  
You say that there is more than one way to skin a cat.  
But we say that there is more than one way to peel a Bannana.  
Prove me Wrong.  
  
Sincerely, "Donkey Kong"

Please download and inspect the ["_BANNANA_.png file"](https://github.com/Nicholas-Heitman/Portfolio/blob/main/CTF%20Competitions/Easy%20Flag/_BANNANA_.wav).  
There is NO MALWARE in this file.  
its still however best practice to operate in a safe virtual sandbox Environment.
