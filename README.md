# My Portfolio of Random Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! - If your a **technical recruiter** I suggest checking out my [CTF Compitionions](https://github.com/Nicholas-Heitman/Portfolio/tree/main/CTF%20Competitions)

This repository serves as a collection of various projects I've created, ranging from small scripts and utilities to more complex applications.  
This repository is a reflection of my journey in coding and infosec development. Each project you find here represents something I've explored, learned, or just had fun building. 
There’s no specific theme or focus; it’s just a mix of whatever has sparked my interest at any given time.

## Projects Included
These projects are open to the public and cover a wide array of topics and technologies.  
You’ll find projects on:
